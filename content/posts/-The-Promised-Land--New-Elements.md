【The Tree of Eternity】

The immortal divine tree, a ten-thousand year old ancient being, is the source of all plant life in Shizhou. It is also regarded as the foundation of the Island of Flowers. The six clan leaders' talismans are carved from its sacred wood, and only those blessed by the Tree of Eternity may earn the talisman and claim leadership over their clan. 

【The Promised Land】

Shizhou, home to the Volume of Time, the immortal Divine Tree, the Mystical Flowers, and six legendary clans, is the ancient Promised Land. Legend has it that those who earn the blessings of the sacred land will master their own fate. The Volume of Time records that the last individuals blessed by this land came from the sea, guided onward by fate's banner.

【The Jewel of Time】

The jewel embedded in the Necklace of Ice and Snow is the Jewel of Time. It is capable of freezing all things, even time itself when its power is most potent. Coveted by the time-crossing gang of thieves and sought after as the key to The Treasure Chest of Time by District 48's successors, its current whereabouts vanished along with the former Tiger Clan's leader.

【The Divine Gate】

Located in the Thrush Clan's territory is an ancient stone gate facing west, where sunset conjures a halo and magnetic field. Even the Thrush Clan dare not approach its vicinity at dusk, deeming the area a forbidden place. Beneath the gate lies ancient text and a rectangular notch, the heart of its ultimate secret."
