【Chrysanthemum Clan】

Only a rare few among the Chrysanthemum Clan are of a special bloodline that lets them manipulate an enemy's will during a total lunar eclipse. Skilled in night combat, they fought fiercely under the moonlight. The youths of this bloodline even sacrificed their own blood, attempting to bend the Wolf Clan's will to their own.
