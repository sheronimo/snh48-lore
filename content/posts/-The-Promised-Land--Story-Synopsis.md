【Act 1: Sanctuary】

With their seals broken, the Wolf Clan unleashed their full might upon Shizhou, waging war against the new generation of the six clans. Centuries of pent-up fury erupted across the land, forcing the six clans to retreat. Having relinquished most territories, the six clans retreated to The Tree of Eternity, their last bastion. The clans' talismans that hung from the Tree of Eternity began to dim, their light fading.

【Act 2: Mark of the Six Clans】

Amidst the chaos, new leaders emerged among the six clans. They  stood defiantly at the front lines, shielding their clanspeople and Shizhou. Before The Tree of Eternity, the divine wood acknowledged their worth, and the talismans, now bonded to their new bearers, radiated anew, awakening the dormant powers stirring within the six clans' new leaders.

【Act 3: In the name of Shizhou】

United beneath The Tree of Eternity as Shizhou's last bastion, the six leaders rallied. Their talismans, which were hewn from the tree's sacred wood, resonated with the tree, channeling the latent natural forces of Shizhou, bestowing a blessing upon the clanspeople to aid them in defeating the Wolf Clan. The six clans purged the Wolf Clan's corruption, sentencing them in the name of Shizhou. Thus, the Promised Land was cleansed, and would no longer be defiled by killing and war.

【Act 4: Newfound Glory (Light)】

Shizhou at long last thawed from its centuries-long winter, its people and earth purified. The former clan leaders, journeying across distant worlds, sensed Shizhou's transformation. The Jewel of Time that had left Shizhou now emitted a radiant light upon the sea's surface, illuminating their path as if responding to Shizhou's change, as if declaring: "I am here."
